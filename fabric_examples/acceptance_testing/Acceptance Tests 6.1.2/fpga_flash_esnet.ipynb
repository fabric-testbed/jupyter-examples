    "# Functional Test 6.1.2 - Flash ESnet code into an FPGA persistent flash or RAM and validate\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook will allow you to flash experimenter FPGA code based on [ONS shell](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic-shell) into the FPGA persistent flash or RAM. If the persistent flash is used, the end result is an FPGA that even after a cold reboot of the server retains its programming with a standard Xilinx XRT shell. If the program is flashed into RAM, a warm reboot of the server will activate it. \n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure can be used to reset the FPGA at a given site after experiments or initialize a newly installed device. It generally follows the procedures described by [ESnet](https://github.com/esnet/esnet-smartnic-fw/blob/main/sn-stack/README.INSTALL.md#running-the-firmware) for U280 devices.\n",

    "  - The cells initializing the state __must always be executed__.\n",

    "- Step 3 is a re-entrant cell and can be used any time you want to refresh information about the existing slice\n",
    "- Step 4 builds 3 docker images and saves them to Storage VM:\n",
    "  - Xilinx Labtools\n",
    "  - DPDK\n",
    "  - esnet-smartnic-fw based on experimenter-provided bitfile artifact\n",
    "  - Only the last one needs to be rebuilt often (for each user) the rest are already saved on the storage VM\n",
    "- Step 5 retrieves existing docker images built in Step 4 at a prior time. This is useful if you are reflashing multiple FPGAs with the same code - you can execute Step 5 once and the skip it for all further VMs simply retrieving the artifacts from Storage VM in this step\n",
    "- Step 6 can be done after Step 5 or Step 6 - that's the actual flashing and it involves identifying and rebooting the underlying server.\n",
    "- Step 7 is an optional 'extend the slice' step that can be excuted if Steps 2 and 3 have been executed.\n",
    "- Step 8 is 'delete the slice' that can be executed any time after Steps 2 and 3 have been executed.\n",
