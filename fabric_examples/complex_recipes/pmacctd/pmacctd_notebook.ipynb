    "#  Introduction\n",
    "The FABRIC testbed is a central hub for large-scale networking experimentation and research, offering a platform for exploring innovative networking technologies. pmacct, a set of open-source passive monitoring tools by Paolo Lucente, is widely used for network traffic monitoring. Integrating pmacct into FABRIC enhances its monitoring capabilities, enabling real-time traffic analysis in an advanced research setting. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project leverages multiple technologies to develop and execute experiments, integrating pmacct into FABRIC to advance network monitoring and experimentation. The goal is to provide real-world tools and settings for computer science and engineering students to explore and innovate in networking.\n",

Two threads are created to run functions run_pmacctd on nodes n1 and n2, executing commands command_n1 and command_n2 respectively.

The use of join() ensures synchronization, waiting for completion of the second thread before ending execution.\n",

Since we are testing the live traffic capabilities of pmacctd, we can use threads so that first the node n1 starts the daemon of pmacctd and then n2 pings 20 times to n1. Then when the second command finishes also the pmacctd tool stops so that we can see the results."

Two threads are created to run functions run_pmacctd on nodes n1 and n2, executing commands command_n1 and command_n2 respectively.

The use of join() ensures synchronization, waiting for completion of the second thread before ending execution.\n",

Since we are testing the live traffic capabilities of pmacctd, we can use threads so that first the node n1 starts the daemon of pmacctd and then n2 pings 20 times to n1. Then when the second command finishes also the pmacctd tool stops so that we can see the results."

They capture metadata including packet counts, timestamps, protocol types, ports, source and destination IP addresses, and so on. Security, traffic analysis, and network monitoring are all done with this data. IPFIX assists in anomaly detection and performance optimization. It is also a more advanced and flexible version of NetFlow, allowing for more detailed and customizable flow information export.\n",

    "This notebook focuses on the integration of pmacctd with FABRIC, but this is not its ultimate goal. The aim is to create an opportunity for future students and individuals interested in networking within the field of computer science to experiment and learn by leveraging the combined capabilities of these two tools. Therefore, I encourage users to continue contributing to this notebook by modifying experiments, tweaking the pmacctd configuration files, experimenting with different topologies, incorporating pmacctd into their own projects, or simply exploring the numerous functionalities that pmacct offers."
