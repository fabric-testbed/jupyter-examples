    "\n",
    "## Introduction to control blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Control blocks are essential for processing a packet. For example, a control block for layer-3 forwarding may require a forwarding table that is indexed by the destination IP address. The control block may include actions to forward a packet when a hit occurs, and to drop the packet otherwise. To forward a packet, a switch must perform routing lookup on the destination IP address. Figure below shows the basic structure of a control block.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./labs_files/lab4/figs/control_blocks.PNG\" width=\"450px\"><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables are essential components that define the processing behavior of a packet inside the switch. A table is specified in the P4 program and has one or more entries (rows) which are populated by the control plane. An entry contains a key, an action, and action data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Key: it is used for lookup operations. The switch builds a key for the incoming packet using one or more header fields (e.g., destination IP address) and then lookups for that value in the table.  </li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Action: once a match occurs, the action specified in the entry is performed by the arithmetic logic unit. Actions are simple operations such as modify a header field, forward the packet to an egress port, and drop the packet. The P4 program contains the possible actions.  </li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>Action data: it can be considered as parameter/s used along with the action. For example, the action data may represent the port number the switch must use to forward the packet. Action data is populated by the control plane.  </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Match types\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of matching: exact match, Longest Prefix match (LPM), and ternary match. They are defined in the standard library (core.p41). Note that architectures may define and implement additional match types. For example, the V1Model2 also has matching based on ranges and selectors. In this lab we will discuss exact match.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exact match\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the exact match lookup is used to search for a specific value of an entry in a table. Assume that Table 2 matches on the destination IP address. If an incoming packet has 10.0.0.2 as the destination IP address, then it will match against the second entry and the P4 program will forward the packet using port 2 as the egress port.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./labs_files/lab4/figs/exact_table.PNG\" width=\"550px\"><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2 shows the ingress control block portion of a P4 program. Two actions are defined, drop and forward. The drop action (lines 5 - 7) invokes the mark_to_drop primitive, causing the packet to be dropped at the end of the ingress processing. The forward action (lines 8 - 10) accepts as input (i.e., action data) the destination port. This parameter is inserted by the control plane and updated in the packet during the ingress processing. In line 9, the P4 program assigns the egress port defined by the control plane to the standard_metadata egress specification field (i.e., the field that the traffic manager looks at to determine which port the packet will be sent to). Lines 11-21 implement a table named ipv4_exact. The match is against the destination IP address using the exact lookup method. The actions associated with the table are forward and drop. The default action which is invoked when there is a miss is drop. The maximum number of entries a table can support is configured manually by the programmer (i.e., 1024 entries, see line 19). Note, however, that the number of entries is limited by the amount of memory in the switch.Figure 2 shows the ingress control block portion of a P4 program. Two actions are defined, drop and forward.

    "\n",
    "Table 2 is an example of a match-action table that uses LPM. Assume that the key is formed with the destination IP address. If an incoming packet has the destination IP address 172.168.3.5, two entries match. The first entry matches because the first 29 bits in the entry are the same as the first 29 bits of the destination IP. The second entry also matches because the first 16 bits in the entry are the same as the first 16 bits of the destination IP. The LPM algorithm will select 172.168.3.0/29 because of the longest prefix preference.\n",
