    "# Hello, FABRIC: Create Your First FABRIC Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook will walk you through creating your first FABRIC experiment. The \"Hello, FABRIC\" experiment tests the configuration of your environment to ensure you can create and access resources on FABRIC.  Specifically, the experiment deploys a slice of resources with a single virtual machine and confirms you can log into the virtual machine using FABLib methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1:  Configure the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, you will need to configure your environment using the [Configure Environment](./configure_environment.ipynb) notebook. Please stop here, open and run that notebook, then return to this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using the FABRIC JupyterHub many of the environment variables will be automatically configured for you.  You will still need to set your bastion username, upload your bastion private key, and set the path to where you put your bastion private key. Your bastion username and private key should already be in your possession.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using the FABRIC API outside of the JupyterHub you will need to configure all of the environment variables. Defaults below will be correct in many situations but you will need to confirm your configuration.  If you have questions about this configuration, please contact the FABRIC admins using the [FABRIC User Forum](https://learn.fabric-testbed.net/forums/) \n",
    "\n",
    "More information about accessing your experiments through the FABRIC bastion hosts can be found [here](https://learn.fabric-testbed.net/knowledge-base/logging-into-fabric-vms/).\n",
