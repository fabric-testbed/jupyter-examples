    "# Programming a P4 Switches\n",
    "Programming a P4 switch, whether targeting hardware or software, requires a dedicated software development environment equipped with a compiler. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 1: Generic workflow design**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Workflow](./figs/p4-workflow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vendor-Provided Components**:\n",
    "   - **Compiler**: Responsible for translating the target-independent P4 source code into platform-specific implementations.\n",
    "   - **Architecture Model**: Defines the capabilities and constraints of the target device.\n",
    "   - **Target Switch**: The hardware or software environment where the data plane logic is deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User-Provided Component**:\n",
    "   - **P4 Source Code**: Customized by the user to specify the desired forwarding logic and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compilation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The compiler translates the user-defined P4 source code into two essential artifacts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Plane Runtime Configuration**:  \n",
    "   - Implements the forwarding logic defined in the P4 program.\n",
    "   - Contains instructions and resource mappings tailored to the specific target switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Runtime Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)**:  \n",
    "   - Enable the control plane or user to interact with the data plane during runtime.\n",
    "   - Support operations such as adding/removing entries in match-action tables and reading/writing the state of external objects (e.g., counters, meters, registers).\n",
    "   - Provide the necessary information for the control plane to manipulate data plane components, including:\n",
    "     - Table identifiers\n",
    "     - Match fields\n",
    "     - Keys\n",
    "     - Action parameters"

    "## Set Up a Network Slice with a P4 Tofino Switch and a Basic P4 Program\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will configure a network slice that utilizes a P4 Tofino switch to run a basic P4 program. The setup will establish connectivity between two nodes via the P4 switch, allowing them to communicate and test connectivity using `ping`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is inspired by the **University of South Carolina CyberTraining program** for P4 programmable devices, which provides hands-on training on using P4 to build and manage network slices effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Access to a P4 Tofino switch**: A programmable hardware device equipped with an Intel Tofino ASIC.\n",
    "2. **Two nodes for connectivity**: Ensure two nodes are physically or virtually connected to the P4 switch.\n",
    "3. **Basic knowledge of P4 programming**: Familiarity with writing, compiling, and deploying P4 programs is necessary.\n",
    "4. **Installed Tofino Software Development Environment (SDE)**: Required tools and libraries for P4 development and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Workflow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compile the P4 Program**:\n",
    "   - Use the **bf-p4c compiler** with the **Tofino Native Architecture (TNA)** to compile the program into a binary file.\n",
    "   - This binary will serve as the data plane runtime configuration for the P4 switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load the Data Plane Program**:\n",
    "   - Load the compiled binary into the P4 switch daemon, ensuring the forwarding logic is active.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configure the Control Plane**:\n",
    "   - Use the **bfrt-python API** to populate the match-action tables, specifying forwarding rules for the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Test Connectivity**:\n",
    "   - Use `ping` to test connectivity between the two nodes and validate that the network slice is functioning as intended.\n",
